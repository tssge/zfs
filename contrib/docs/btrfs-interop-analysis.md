# btrfs send/recv Interoperability Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of both ZFS and btrfs send/recv stream formats,
**converting btrfs send/recv streams into ZFS streams is not feasible** due to
fundamental incompatibilities in data models, addressing schemes, and semantic
differences between the filesystems.

## Technical Analysis

### ZFS Stream Format

ZFS streams (`zstreams`) use a binary format with these characteristics:

- **Magic Number**: `0x2F5bacbacULL` (`DMU_BACKUP_MAGIC`)
- **Structure**: Sequence of `dmu_replay_record_t` structures
- **Data Model**: DMU (Data Management Unit) object-based
- **Addressing**: Object IDs with offsets within objects
- **Checksumming**: Fletcher-4 algorithm
- **Features**: Integrated compression, encryption, deduplication

**Record Types**:
- `DRR_BEGIN`: Stream header with dataset metadata
- `DRR_OBJECT`: DMU object creation/modification  
- `DRR_WRITE`: Block-level data writes
- `DRR_FREE`: Block-level data freeing
- `DRR_END`: Stream termination
- Plus specialized records for deduplication, encryption, etc.

### btrfs send/recv Format

btrfs streams use a different binary format:

- **Magic Number**: Different from ZFS (btrfs-specific)
- **Structure**: Sequence of command structures
- **Data Model**: File/directory based with extents
- **Addressing**: File paths and inode numbers
- **Checksumming**: CRC32
- **Features**: Copy-on-write, extent sharing, subvolumes

**Command Types**:
- `BTRFS_SEND_C_SUBVOL`: Subvolume operations
- `BTRFS_SEND_C_MKFILE`/`BTRFS_SEND_C_MKDIR`: File/directory creation
- `BTRFS_SEND_C_WRITE`: File-level writes
- `BTRFS_SEND_C_CLONE`: Extent cloning/reflinks
- `BTRFS_SEND_C_SET_XATTR`: Extended attribute operations
- Plus many POSIX filesystem operations

## Fundamental Incompatibilities

### 1. Data Model Mismatch

**ZFS**: Object-based storage where everything is a DMU object
- Files are objects containing block pointers
- Directories are ZAP (ZFS Attribute Processor) objects
- Metadata stored as object properties

**btrfs**: Traditional filesystem with inodes and extents
- Files/directories represented as inodes
- Data stored in extents with COW semantics
- Metadata stored as extended attributes and B-tree structures

**Impact**: No direct mapping between DMU objects and btrfs inodes/extents.

### 2. Addressing Schemes

**ZFS**: 
- Objects identified by 64-bit object IDs
- Data addressed as (object, offset) pairs
- Block pointers contain physical addresses and checksums

**btrfs**:
- Files identified by inode numbers and paths
- Data addressed through extent references
- Logical to physical mapping through B-trees

**Impact**: Cannot translate btrfs extent references to ZFS block pointers.

### 3. Metadata Systems

**ZFS**: 
- Dataset properties (compression, checksum, quota, etc.)
- Property inheritance through dataset hierarchy
- ZFS-specific attributes

**btrfs**:
- POSIX extended attributes
- Subvolume properties
- btrfs-specific metadata

**Impact**: No equivalent mapping for many metadata types.

### 4. Snapshot Semantics

**ZFS**:
- Dataset snapshots with unique GUIDs
- Incremental streams based on transaction groups
- Snapshot relationships tracked via GUIDs

**btrfs**:
- Subvolume snapshots with UUIDs  
- Incremental streams based on file-level changes
- Parent/child subvolume relationships

**Impact**: Different snapshot identification and relationship tracking.

### 5. Feature Set Differences

**ZFS**:
- Integrated deduplication with DDT (Dedup Table)
- Block-level compression and encryption
- ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache) awareness

**btrfs**:
- Extent-based deduplication
- File/extent-level compression
- Different caching strategies

**Impact**: Feature translation would lose efficiency and semantics.

## Implementation Challenges

Even if attempted, conversion would face these technical hurdles:

1. **Complex State Reconstruction**: Would need to reconstruct ZFS object
   hierarchy from file operations
2. **Lossy Translation**: Many btrfs features have no ZFS equivalent (and vice
   versa)
3. **Performance**: File-by-file translation would be extremely slow
4. **Reliability**: High risk of data corruption due to semantic mismatches
5. **Incremental Streams**: No way to maintain proper parent/child
   relationships

## Conclusion

Converting btrfs send/recv streams to ZFS streams is **not technically feasible** due to:

- Incompatible data models (object-based vs file-based)
- Different addressing schemes (object IDs vs file paths)
- Irreconcilable metadata systems
- Different snapshot and incremental semantics
- Feature set mismatches

## Recommended Alternatives

For migrating data from btrfs to ZFS:

1. **File-level migration**: Use `rsync`, `tar`, or `cp` for data transfer
2. **Custom migration tools**: Create utilities that read btrfs filesystems
   directly and create new ZFS datasets
3. **Application-level backups**: Use application-specific backup formats that
   both filesystems can handle
4. **Intermediate formats**: Convert through neutral formats like tar archives

These approaches, while potentially slower, preserve data integrity and avoid
the semantic translation problems inherent in stream format conversion.
